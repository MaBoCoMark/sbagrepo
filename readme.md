# Tarui RL Overlay

> **🚀 Say goodbye to IPC overhead!**
>
> RL **[v2.72 update](https://www.rocketleague.com/news/rocket-league-patch-notes-v2-72#:~:text=Added%20WebSocket%20support)** introduced the new `WebSocket` support, we shifted from our ~~legacy TCP~~ pipeline to native `WebSocket`. By connecting directly from JS, we are able to completely eliminate cross-process IPC overhead

--------

Whenever `pre-` and `post-`**compilation** behaviors differ, your **first step** should be running the `debug build` action to verify the resource tree.

`pnpm tsc --noEmit` to check errors before upload.

`find . -maxdepth 3 -not -path '*/.*' -not -path './node_modules*'` to output files tree.
